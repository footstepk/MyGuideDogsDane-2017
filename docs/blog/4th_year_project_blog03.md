# Reviews Android app components

## After few consultation on YouTube channel and Android’s developer blogs, I realized my app activity component in the situation 
There are four different types of app components: 
•	Activities.
•	Services.
•	Content providers.
•	Broadcast receivers.

Each type serves a distinct purpose and has a distinct lifecycle that defines how the component is created and destroyed.

# My aim for this week
•	I need to finish design my recording route functionality
•	Once finish off the designing, I need to tihnk, which package to determine my record points
•	All I need is focusing hard on the problem.

##Which one I need?
The location.service packages thats all I need to examine for the GPS trip distance.
