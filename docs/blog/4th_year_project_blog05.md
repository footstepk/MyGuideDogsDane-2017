## The activity of tell me where am I
I have been considered where should I have the "CheckMyLocation" button to be placed to maximize a best user experience (UX), I firmly believe that, I just want suit me and I thought the best position will be on the bottom left as I stated on the function spec.
The activity is completed, I have tested it, it gave me a text view "with my current location". Brilliant! I need testing more location to ensuring this is the right coding that I did.

##The activity of recording a route
Surely this is the most tricky part for me. I been asked by Mark(Supervisor) what types of data you going to store in your database. 
Solution isn't a clear one, however, I been looking a tutorial on the Android website, this is good for me!

The type values for the recorded route will be in a double object and create a SQLLite Database.

##The activity of exploring surrounding areas
This is all about the Geo-Google Map APIs.
