# Google Places APIs documentations

   Getting start use of Google Places APIs [1] there are many to grasp here on this Places API. If you read this documentation, there are some degree how can deploy the library code to assist the accuracy when I explore the surroundind areas.
As I mentioned before, I need to test it out the activity with my phone rather than the emulator.

# Local Data Around The World

   Get data from the same database used by Google Maps and Google+ Local. Places features over 100 million businesses and points of interest that are updated frequently through owner-verified listings and user-moderated contributions. 

## Place picker

   In this add the built-in place picker UI widget to the app, so users can choose from a set of nearby places displayed on a map.  Nonetheless, I am asking myself, do I need include  this map for viewing (this is a non visual app)?
Or, just create a string representation to read it out by text-to-speech?


## Place autocomplete

  Again, do I need this keyboard interaction done? This is Automatically fills in the name and / or address of a place as you type.?
