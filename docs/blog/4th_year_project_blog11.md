# Project Completion

The MyGuideDogsDane project is closing to complete phase and I am now focussing the undergoing exam on May.
I just tested the app's activity, and it look fine for me, however, I need some arrangement to record the video walkthrough. I can't see, how I going to record the video? I need a help for this.


# Technology Guide Documentation

According to the Humphry's website about the 4th year project, the technical guide involves these yeah:
project motivation
project research
project design
project implementation
project sample code
project problems solved
project results
project future work

I wonder do I need to include the technical specification?
