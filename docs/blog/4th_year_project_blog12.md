# Project Feedback

I released MyGuideDogsDane app to friend for trial and I asked for their feedback.  I just received a phone call from my friend (in Malaysia), their feedback was phenomenal and positive.
They recognised the real-time information while walking it to an unfamiliar place and they able to record a landmark and use that archive landmark to navigate back to the route they went before!

# Design Conclusion

I wask asked whether to allow an UI button view to be addded for interaction previously, after the feedback, my friend they like the way I implemented as in "one touch" and "scroll down" ideas rather than interacting the information details by pointing one-by-one.
I thought this is much realistically and convenience and the whole concept is just trying to minimize to interact with the UI screen activity or any real-time information.

# Query About The Project

I read some one post it in facebook by saying the archive history about the project activities should be posted into the Gitlab website.  I would ask, if you haven't finish your project, what is the point to upload it to Gitlab and all the job is concentration on the project yeah?

# Request A Trial 

After the exam today CA4006 Concurrent and Distributed Programming, I want ask my supervisor which is Mark to test my app, as he requested, he wants get the app running as a trial prior to the Demo date which has been assigned on the 1st of June.
