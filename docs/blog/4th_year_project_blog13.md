While I still got upto 22 May to deliver my project, I have one specific functionality I want to add into my project. Here is the function:
When users(s) start from a point says, point A and finish in point B and user(s) wish to return to its origin point and the app will navigate back from the point its start.
I also added the compass helper to facilitate the navigation, because it will make sense how user(s) will know where they  facing to a direction.
