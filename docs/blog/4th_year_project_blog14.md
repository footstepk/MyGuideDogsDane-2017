# Backtrack Functionality

As mentioned in previously, I have completed the coding to get the backtrack functionality done and work.
One thing to mention here, I am still thinking what will be the best way to implement this backtrack function?
Q1. creat a UI button as "BackTrack"?
Q2. Double tab on the screen while walking it?

The code that I wrote is in double tab, I really want some feedback again from my friends!

# Preparation For Video Screen Capture

I am now busying to record a screen capture for this project, I use the Android app EUDigital recorder, I really whether the quality was good enough to show the video footage.
Please don't blame me, I really can't watch the video!

# Main App Screen Layout

I had motified the UI style and its text, I want this make clear to represent on each activity functionality!
