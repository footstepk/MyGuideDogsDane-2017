# Backtrack Functionality

The backtracked worked for me, it just a bit delay when pressing / tab on the screen with 2 fingers.
The reason was any talk back turned on, 2 gestures must be used in this case.

# Testing The Validation

I am writing my validation for the test. Each of the test is conducted by myself with the app with me on the road. Look okay!
I also use the external speaker see how its respond, because I want connect it to external speaker to get better voice.
Note: using the earphone wasn't not a good thing I think in this case.
